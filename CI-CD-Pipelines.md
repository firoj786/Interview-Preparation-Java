CI/CD Pipeline Explained in Simple Terms


SDLC with CI/CD

The software development life cycle (SDLC) includes stages like development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. CI/CD automates and integrates these stages for faster, more reliable releases. Code pushed to a git repository triggers automated build and test processes. End-to-end (e2e) tests validate the code. Passing tests allow automatic deployment to staging/production; failures send code back for fixes. This provides quick feedback and reduces production bugs.

Difference between CI and CD
- Continuous Integration (CI): Automates build, test, and merge processes. Runs tests on every commit to catch integration issues early, encouraging frequent commits and rapid feedback.

- Continuous Delivery (CD): Automates release processes, including infrastructure changes and deployment. Ensures reliable software releases at any time, potentially automating manual testing and approval steps.

CI/CD Pipeline
1. Developer commits code to source control.

2. CI server detects changes and triggers a build.

3. Code is compiled and tested (unit, integration tests).

4. Test results are reported to the developer.

5. Successful builds are deployed to staging environments.

6. Further testing may occur in staging.

7. CD system deploys approved changes to production.
