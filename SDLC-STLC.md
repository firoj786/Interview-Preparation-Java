SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a structured process used by software development teams to design, create, test, and deploy high-quality software applications. The SDLC is composed of several phases, each with its specific objectives and deliverables. The main stages of the SDLC are as follows.
 
1. Requirements Gathering: During this initial phase, the software development team interacts with stakeholders to gather and document their requirements This involves understanding the purpose of the software, its functionality, and the target audience.
 
2. Analysis and Design: In this phase, the gathered requirements are analyzed, and the software architecture and design are planned. It involves creating a detailed blueprint of the software, defining data structures, and outlining the overall system design.
 
3. Implementation or Coding. The actual development of the software takes place in this phase. Developers write the code based on the design specifications and programming languages chosen for the project. 4.
 
Testing The software is thoroughly tested in this stage to identify and fix any defects or issues. Various testing methodologies like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing are used to ensure the software's quality and functionality.
 
5. Deployment. Once the testing phase is completed successfully, the software is deployed to the production environment or made available to end-users.
 
6. Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters its maintenance phase. Updates, bug fixes, and enhancements are regularly applied to keep the software up to date and running smoothly.
 
It is important to note that there are several variations of the SDLC and some models might include additional stages or merge some of the mentioned phases. The choice of SDLC model often depends on the project's size, complexity, budget, and specific requirements. Common SDLC models include the Waterfall model, Agile model, V-Model, and Spiral model. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and the selection of the appropriate model can significantly impact the software development process.
 

-->STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle. It is a process followed by software testing teams to ensure that software applications are thoroughly tested and meet the desired quality standards. The STLC consists of various phases that guide testers through the testing process. The typical phases of the Software Testing Life Cycle are as follows.
 
1. Requirement Analysis: In this phase, testers carefully review and analyze the software requirements to understand what needs to be tested. They create test plans and test cases based on the requirements to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
 
2. Test Planning: Test planning involves defining the testing scope, objectives, resources, and schedules. Testers identify the types of testing (e.g.. functional testing, performance testing, security testing) required for the project and allocate resources accordingly.
 
3. Test Design: In this phase, detailed test cases are created based on the test plan. Testers specify the input data, expected outcomes, and the steps to execute each test case. Test design ensures that all aspects of the software are adequately covered in the testing process.
 
4. Test Environment Setup: A suitable testing environment is set up to replicate the production environment where the software will be used. This includes hardware, software, and network configurations necessary for testing.
 
5. Test Execution: During this phase, test cases are executed in the test environment. Testers run the tests and observe the software's behavior, comparing the actual results with the expected outcomes.
 
6. Defect Reporting. If any issues or defects are found during test execution, they are reported to the development team for resolution. Testers provide detailed information about each defect, making it easier for developers to reproduce and fix the issues.
 
7. Defect Retesting and Regression Testing: After the developers fix the reported defects, testers retest the fixed functionality to ensure that the
 
issues are resolved. Additionally, regression testing is performed to verify that the changes do not impact other parts of the software
 
8. Test Closure: Once all testing activities are completed, the testing team prepares test summary reports and other relevant documentation. The test closure phase involves evaluating the testing process and gathering insights for future improvements,
 
The STLC is an integral part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and ensures that the software is thoroughly tested at different stages of development. Following the STLC helps in delivering a reliable and high-quality software product to end-users.
