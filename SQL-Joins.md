SQL Joins Explained

Joins in SQL are operations used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column between them. They allow you to retrieve data that is spread across multiple tables by specifying how the records should be combined, typically through matching values in key columns like primary and foreign keys.

➡️ INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.

➡️ LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right table; unmatched records from the right table are returned as 
NULL.

➡️ RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left table; unmatched records from the left table are returned as NULL.

➡️ FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table, with NULL for unmatched rows.

➡️ CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of all rows in both tables, pairing each row from one table with all rows from the other.

➡️ SELF JOIN: Joins a table with itself as if it were two separate tables.

Here are the top ways to improve database performance:

1. Indexing
Create the right indexes based on query patterns to speed up data retrieval.

2. Materialized Views
Store pre-computed query results for quick access, reducing the need to process complex queries repeatedly.

3. Vertical Scaling
Increase the capacity of the database server by adding more CPU, RAM, or storage.

4. Denormalization
Reduce complex joins by restructuring data, which can improve query performance.

5. Database Caching
Store frequently accessed data in a faster storage layer to reduce load on the database.

6. Replication
Create copies of the primary database on different servers to distribute read load and enhance availability.

7. Sharding
Divide the database into smaller, manageable pieces, or shards, to distribute load and improve performance.

8. Partitioning
Split large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces to improve query performance and maintenance.

9. Query Optimization
Rewrite and fine-tune queries to execute more efficiently.

10. Use of Appropriate Data Types
Select the most efficient data types for each column to save space and speed up processing.

11. Limiting Indexes
Avoid excessive indexing, which can slow down write operations; use indexes judiciously.

12. Archiving Old Data
Move infrequently accessed data to an archive to keep the active database smaller and faster.
