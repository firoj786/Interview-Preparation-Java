Real-World Examples of Data Structures.

Data structures are the building blocks of software, helping to organize and store information efficiently. They are not just theoretical concepts; they are used in many applications that we interact with daily.

Here are some real-world examples of how these data structures are used:

🔸 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁

𝗢𝗻𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝘁 — an ordered collection of items with the ability to access items at specific positions.

🔸 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁

𝗕𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘀𝗲𝗿 𝗵𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 — enables quick and efficient traversal backward and forward through the history.

🔸 𝗛𝗮𝘀𝗵 𝗧𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲

𝗖𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 — Many caching algorithms, like in web browsers and content delivery systems, use hash tables to quickly look up values based on a key.

🔸 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸

𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗼 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 — Last In, First Out (LIFO) the last element added is the first one to be removed.

🔸 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘂𝗲

𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘂𝗲 — follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, print jobs are processed in the order they are received.

🔸 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵

𝗦𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗮 𝗻𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 — helps in suggesting new friends, finding mutual connections, and disseminating posts through the network.

🔸 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲

𝗙𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 — trees are hierarchical in nature, mirroring the organizational structure of directories and subdirectories. Many file systems are represented as trees with directories as nodes.

🔸 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗶𝘅

𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 — utilizes a two-dimensional array to represent a grid and determine the shortest path from one point to another.

🔸 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗽

𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘂𝗲 — efficiently ensures that the element with the highest priority is always readily accessible.
