Microservices architecture breaks down applications into smaller, independent services. Here's a rundown of the 𝟏𝟎 𝐤𝐞𝐲 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 in this architecture:

1. 𝐂𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭

These are the end-users who interact with the application via different interfaces like web, mobile, or PC.

2. 𝐂𝐃𝐍 (Content Delivery Network)

CDNs deliver static content like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files efficiently by caching them closer to the user's location, reducing load times.

3. 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫

It distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers, ensuring no single server becomes a bottleneck and improving the application's availability and reliability.

4. 𝐀𝐏𝐈 𝐆𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐰𝐚𝐲

An API Gateway acts as an entry point for all clients, handling tasks like request routing, composition, and protocol translation, which helps manage multiple microservices behind the scenes.

5. 𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬

Each microservice is a small, independent service that performs a specific business function. They communicate with each other via APIs. 

6. 𝐌𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐁𝐫𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐫

A message broker facilitates communication between microservices by sending messages between them, ensuring they remain decoupled and can function independently.

7. 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬

Each microservice typically has its own database to ensure loose coupling. This can involve different databases for different microservices

8. 𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐫

This component handles user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to services.

9. 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲

This system keeps track of all microservices and their instances, allowing services to find and communicate with each other dynamically.

10. 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 (e.g., Zookeeper)

Tools like Zookeeper help manage and coordinate distributed services, ensuring they work together smoothly.

In a microservices architecture, each microservice should generally have its own database. Here's why:

𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞: Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. If they shared a database, changes in one service's schema might break another service.

𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: Each team can choose the best database technology for their service's needs, like SQL for one and NoSQL for another, allowing more flexibility and optimization.

𝐈𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Issues like data corruption or a heavy query load in one service won’t directly affect others.

𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠: Services can be scaled independently based on their specific demands, optimizing resource usage and performance.


Why Each Microservices Should have it's Own DataBase?

1. Independence.
Each Microservice can be developed, deployed . and managed independently.

Service A->DB1
Sevice B->DB2
Service C-> DB3

2. Decentralized Data Management.
Each Microservice can choose it's own Database technology.

Service A->SQL
Service B->MongoDB
Service C->PostgreSQL

3. Isolation.
Data Corruption or heavy query load in one service won't impact others.

Service A->DB1
Service B->DB2
Service C->DB3

4. Scaling.
Service can be scaled independently.

Service A->DB1
Service B->DB2
Service C->DB3
