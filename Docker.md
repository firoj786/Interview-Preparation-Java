1. Docker Client:

- Interfaces with Docker through commands like 'docker push', 'docker pull', 'docker run', and 'docker build'

- Communicates with the Docker daemon via REST API

2. Docker Host:

- Contains the Docker Daemon (dockerd), the workhorse of Docker operations

- Manages containers, which are isolated, lightweight runtime environments

- Handles images, the blueprints for containers

3. Registry (Docker Hub):

- Acts as a repository for Docker images

- Can be public (like Docker Hub) or private

- Enables sharing and distribution of container images

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀:

- 'docker push': Upload images to a registry

- 'docker pull': Download images from a registry

- 'docker run': Create and start a new container

- 'docker build': Build a new image from a Dockerfile

1. Traditional Virtualization:

- Uses a hypervisor to create multiple virtual machines (VMs)

- Each VM runs a full OS, resulting in higher resource overhead

2. Container Architecture:

- Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight

- Allows for higher density and more efficient resource utilization

Benefits of Docker:

1. Consistency: "It works on my machine" becomes a problem of the past

2. Isolation: Applications and dependencies are self-contained

3. Portability: Run anywhere that supports Docker

4. Efficiency: Faster startup times and lower resource usage compared to VMs

5. Scalability: Easily scale applications up or down

Use Cases:

- Microservices architecture

- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines

- Development environments

- Application packaging and distribution.
