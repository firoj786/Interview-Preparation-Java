What is Docker?
Docker is a containerization platform used to develop, ship, and run containers. Docker doesn't use a hypervisor, and you can run Docker on your desktop or laptop if you're developing and testing applications. The desktop version of Docker supports Linux, Windows, and macOS. For production systems, Docker is available for server environments, including many variants of Linux and Microsoft Windows Server 2016 and above. Many clouds, including Azure, support Docker.

What is a container?
A container is a loosely isolated environment that allows us to build and run software packages. These software packages include the code and all dependencies to run applications quickly and reliably on any computing environment. We call these packages container images.

The container image becomes the unit we use to distribute our applications.

What is software containerization?
Software containerization is an OS-virtualization method used to deploy and run containers without using a virtual machine (VM). Containers can run on physical hardware, in the cloud, on VMs, and across multiple operating systems.

Docker architecture
The Docker platform consists of several components that we use to build, run, and manage our containerized applications.

-----Docker Engine-----
The Docker Engine consists of several components configured as a client-server implementation where the client and server run simultaneously on the same host. The client communicates with the server using a REST API, which enables the client to also communicate with a remote server instance.

The Docker client
There are two alternatives for Docker client: A command-line application named docker or a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based application called Docker Desktop. Both the CLI and Docker Desktop interact with a Docker server. The docker commands from the CLI or Docker Desktop use the Docker REST API to send instructions to either a local or remote server and function as the primary interface we use to manage our containers.

The Docker server
The Docker server is a daemon named dockerd. The dockerd daemon responds to requests from the client via the Docker REST API and can interact with other daemons. The Docker server is also responsible for tracking the lifecycle of our containers.

Docker objects
There are several objects that you'll create and configure to support your container deployments. These include networks, storage volumes, plugins, and other service objects. We won't cover all of these objects here, but it's good to keep in mind that these objects are items that we can create and deploy as needed.

Docker Hub
Docker Hub is a Software as a Service (SaaS) Docker container registry. Docker registries are repositories that we use to store and distribute the container images we create. Docker Hub is the default public registry Docker uses for image management.

Keep in mind that you can create and use a private Docker registry or use one of the many cloud provider options available. For example, you can use Azure Container Registry to store container images to use in several Azure container-enabled services.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's how it works:

1. Developer: Writes the code and creates a Dockerfile, which specifies the environment and dependencies needed for the application.

2. Client: Commands like `docker build`, `docker pull`, `docker run`, and `docker push` are used to interact with Docker.

3. Dockerfile: Contains instructions to create a Docker image, starting from a base image (e.g., `postgres:latest`), setting environment variables, and exposing ports.

4. Docker Daemon: Runs on the Docker host, managing images and containers.

5. Docker Host: The machine where Docker Daemon is running, managing container lifecycle.

6. Images: Packaged environments and applications stored in a registry, like Docker Hub, including dependencies and configurations.

7. Containers: Isolated environments created from Docker images to run applications consistently.

Commands:

- `docker build`: Creates an image from the Dockerfile.

- `docker pull`: Downloads an image from a registry.

- `docker run`: Launches a container from an image.

- `docker push`: Uploads an image to a registry.

This process allows for easy and consistent application deployment, leveraging images and containers to ensure everything works seamlessly from development to production.





𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻:

1. Docker Client:

- Interfaces with Docker through commands like 'docker push', 'docker pull', 'docker run', and 'docker build'

- Communicates with the Docker daemon via REST API

2. Docker Host:

- Contains the Docker Daemon (dockerd), the workhorse of Docker operations

- Manages containers, which are isolated, lightweight runtime environments

- Handles images, the blueprints for containers

3. Registry (Docker Hub):

- Acts as a repository for Docker images

- Can be public (like Docker Hub) or private

- Enables sharing and distribution of container images

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀:

- 'docker push': Upload images to a registry

- 'docker pull': Download images from a registry

- 'docker run': Create and start a new container

- 'docker build': Build a new image from a Dockerfile

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘃𝘀. 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗩𝗶𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:

1. Traditional Virtualization:

- Uses a hypervisor to create multiple virtual machines (VMs)

- Each VM runs a full OS, resulting in higher resource overhead

2. Container Architecture:

- Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight

- Allows for higher density and more efficient resource utilization

Benefits of Docker:

1. Consistency: "It works on my machine" becomes a problem of the past

2. Isolation: Applications and dependencies are self-contained

3. Portability: Run anywhere that supports Docker

4. Efficiency: Faster startup times and lower resource usage compared to VMs

5. Scalability: Easily scale applications up or down

Use Cases:

- Microservices architecture

- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines

- Development environments

- Application packaging and distribution.
