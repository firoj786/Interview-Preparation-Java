How do we design effective and safe APIs?

APIs have increasingly become the backbone of modern software.

𝗧𝗼 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱 some of the 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘀 and 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻, Let's 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘇𝗲 𝗮 𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗮 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗲𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲:

🔹 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴

Clarity is key when creating APIs.

Adopting simple resource names, like /users for accessing user profiles and /posts for retrieving user posts, streamlines the development process and reduces mental strain.

🔹 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗽𝗹𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹𝘀

It's important to maintain a standard of consistency in API design.

For consistency and readability, use plural resource names, such as GET /users/{userId}/friends vs. /friend), to avoid ambiguity in API requests.

🔹 𝗖𝗿𝗼𝘀𝘀-𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲𝘀

Interlinking resources, like taking comments on a post using GET /posts/{postId}/comments, simplifies the retrieval of related data.

It provides a more streamlined and well-organized user experience.

🔹 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆

It goes without saying, security is a must-have. 

To secure the API endpoints, employ authentication methods like X-AUTH-TOKEN and X-SIGNATURE, and use authorization headers for verifying user permissions.

🔹 𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴

Using versioning and communicating version updates is another important practice. 

Endpoints like GET /v2/users/{userId}/posts allow API versioning to maintain functionality regardless of updates.

This approach ensures backward compatibility and a smooth transition for users and us.

🔹 𝗣𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

This technique is important for performance.

Paginate large datasets, like feeds or comment lists, with GET /posts?page=5&pageSize=20 to enhance data delivery and UX.

🔹 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆

Maintaining API reliability is necessary.

Idempotency ensures that operations like profile updates (PUT /users/{userId}/profile) achieve their intended result, regardless of how often they are executed.

These practices are very important, but there’s still much more to API design.
